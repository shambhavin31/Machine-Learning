# Project Name
> Bike Sharing Assignment.


## General Information
- Prblem Statement.
BoomBikes wants to understand which features are most important and are affecting the shared bike demand.
Our goal is to understand the varaious indepent varaible impacting business.


## Conclusions


-Key predictors influencing bike demand include atemp (feeling temperature), windspeed, weather conditions, and whether it's a holiday or a working day.

-Atemp (Feeling Temperature): There is a positive correlation between feeling temperature (in the range of 10-30 degrees Celsius) and bike demand. As the temperature increases within this range, we observe a notable increase in bike rentals.

-windspeed: Lower windspeeds are associated with higher bike demand. This suggests that calm weather conditions tend to positively influence the decision to rent bikes.

-Holiday vs. Working Day: Bike demand is higher on holidays compared to an average working day. This difference in demand pattern highlights the influence of weekdays versus holidays on bike rental behaviour

-The month variable also plays a crucial role in our linear regression model's performance. Specifically, we observed higher demand for shared bikes from June to September.

- Weather conditions also have a notable impact on our linear regression model. For instance, our analysis reveals that bike demand is higher during cloudy weather conditions
